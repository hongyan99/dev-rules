# Deployment Rules

## 1. Automation

- Automate deployment processes to ensure consistency
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) for environment provisioning
- Create repeatable deployment scripts and procedures
- Implement continuous deployment where appropriate
- Automate configuration management

## 2. Environment Management

- Maintain parity between development, staging, and production environments
- Document the configuration of each environment
- Use environment-specific configuration files or environment variables
- Limit access to production environments
- Implement secure credential management

## 3. Deployment Strategy

- Plan for zero-downtime deployments where possible
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts
- Consider canary deployments or blue-green deployment strategies
- Have a clear rollback plan for every deployment
- Schedule deployments during low-traffic periods when necessary

## 4. Verification

- Verify application health after deployment
- Run smoke tests in the deployed environment
- Monitor key metrics during and after deployment
- Verify database migrations and data integrity
- Check integration points with external systems

## 5. Documentation

- Document all deployment procedures
- Maintain a deployment history log
- Document configuration changes between versions
- Create and maintain runbooks for common operational tasks
- Ensure documentation is accessible to all relevant team members

## 6. Communication

- Notify stakeholders before and after significant deployments
- Communicate deployment schedule to affected teams
- Document known issues and workarounds in release notes
- Establish clear communication channels for deployment issues
- Conduct post-deployment reviews for significant releases

## 7. Security

- Scan for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Verify security configurations in the target environment
- Ensure proper access controls are in place
- Audit deployment-related credentials regularly
- Verify that sensitive data is appropriately protected

## 8. Performance

- Monitor application performance before, during, and after deployment
- Verify load balancer and auto-scaling configurations
- Test system under expected load conditions
- Monitor database performance post-deployment
- Verify cache configurations and behavior

## Deployment Phase Focus Tips

- Use deployment checklists to ensure consistent processes
- Implement progressive deployment strategies for large changes
- Conduct pre-deployment reviews for high-risk changes
- Ensure on-call support is available after significant deployments
- Practice emergency rollbacks and recovery procedures
- Consider compliance requirements in deployment processes
