# Sequential Thinking Example: Adapter Selection Use Case

This document provides an example of how sequential thinking might be applied to the adapter selection logic in our system. This is a conceptual example of the approach rather than actual implementation code.

## Use Case: Intelligent Adapter Selection

**Problem**: Select the most appropriate LLM adapter for a given task based on multiple factors including:
- Task requirements
- Performance characteristics
- Cost considerations
- Availability
- Previous performance

## Sequential Thinking Approach

Below is a conceptual representation of how the tool would process this decision, showing each thought step and how it builds on previous reasoning.

```python
# Conceptual representation of sequential thinking process
# Not actual implementation code

def select_adapter_with_sequential_thinking(task_description, available_adapters, historical_data):
    # Initialize the sequential thinking process
    sequential_thinking = SequentialThinking()
    
    # The tool would manage these steps internally
    sequential_thinking.add_thought(
        thought="First, I need to identify the key requirements of this task.",
        thought_number=1,
        total_thoughts=5  # Initial estimate
    )
    
    # Extract task requirements
    task_analysis = analyze_task(task_description)
    
    sequential_thinking.add_thought(
        thought=f"Based on the task description, this appears to be a {task_analysis['type']} task requiring {task_analysis['capabilities']}. The complexity level is {task_analysis['complexity']}.",
        thought_number=2,
        total_thoughts=5
    )
    
    # Evaluate available adapters
    sequential_thinking.add_thought(
        thought="Now I'll evaluate each available adapter based on the required capabilities.",
        thought_number=3,
        total_thoughts=6  # Adjusted estimate as reasoning progresses
    )
    
    adapter_evaluations = {}
    for adapter in available_adapters:
        capability_match = evaluate_capability_match(adapter, task_analysis)
        adapter_evaluations[adapter.name] = capability_match
    
    # This thought might revise a previous conclusion
    sequential_thinking.add_thought(
        thought=f"After examining the adapters, I see that {list_top_adapters(adapter_evaluations, 2)} have the strongest capability match. However, I need to consider performance and cost factors as well.",
        thought_number=4,
        total_thoughts=6,
        is_revision=True,
        revises_thought=3
    )
    
    # Consider historical performance
    if historical_data:
        sequential_thinking.add_thought(
            thought="I should examine historical performance for similar tasks.",
            thought_number=5,
            total_thoughts=7  # Further adjusted as new considerations emerge
        )
        
        perf_analysis = analyze_historical_performance(historical_data, list(adapter_evaluations.keys()), task_analysis)
        
        sequential_thinking.add_thought(
            thought=f"Historical data shows that {perf_analysis['best_performer']} has {perf_analysis['success_rate']}% success rate on similar tasks, while {perf_analysis['runner_up']} has {perf_analysis['runner_up_rate']}% success rate.",
            thought_number=6,
            total_thoughts=7
        )
    
    # Make a decision with explicit reasoning
    final_selection = determine_final_selection(adapter_evaluations, perf_analysis)
    
    sequential_thinking.add_thought(
        thought=f"Taking all factors into account, {final_selection['adapter']} is the most appropriate choice because {final_selection['reason']}. The expected performance is {final_selection['expected_performance']} with a cost factor of {final_selection['cost_factor']}.",
        thought_number=7,
        total_thoughts=7,
        next_thought_needed=False  # Indicates this is the final thought
    )
    
    # The sequential thinking process would return both the result and the reasoning chain
    return {
        "selected_adapter": final_selection['adapter'],
        "reasoning": sequential_thinking.get_reasoning_chain(),
        "confidence": final_selection['confidence']
    }
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Transparent Decision-Making**: The reasoning process is explicit and can be audited
2. **Adaptability**: The thinking process can adjust as new information is considered
3. **Self-Revision**: Earlier conclusions can be revised as more context becomes available
4. **Complexity Management**: The step-by-step approach handles multiple factors systematically

## Comparison to Traditional Approach

### Traditional Approach:

```python
def select_adapter_traditional(task_description, available_adapters):
    task_type = determine_task_type(task_description)
    
    # Often uses predetermined rules or simple scoring
    if task_type == "creative":
        return get_adapter_by_name("gpt_adapter")
    elif task_type == "factual":
        return get_adapter_by_name("gemini_adapter")
    else:
        return get_adapter_by_name("default_adapter")
```

### Key Differences:

1. **Reasoning Depth**: Sequential thinking considers more factors and their interactions
2. **Adaptability**: Traditional approaches often use fixed rules vs. adaptive reasoning
3. **Transparency**: Sequential thinking provides the full reasoning chain for review
4. **Evolution**: The sequential approach can incorporate new considerations as they arise

## Next Steps for Evaluation

To properly evaluate this approach, we would need to:

1. Implement a proof-of-concept using the actual MCP sequential thinking tool
2. Test with a range of real-world task requirements
3. Compare the decisions to those made by traditional logic
4. Measure factors like:
   - Decision quality (via human evaluation)
   - Processing time
   - Adaptability to new task types
   - Handling of edge cases

## Connection to Rule Repository

This example relates to the following rule areas:
- Interface Contract Management (adapter interfaces)
- Implementation Phase Rules (runtime decision logic)
- Performance Optimization (selecting optimal components)

## Notes

This is a conceptual example to illustrate the potential application of sequential thinking. Actual implementation would require integration with the MCP sequential thinking API and our existing adapter framework.
