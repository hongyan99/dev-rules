# Requirements Analysis Rules

## 1. Clarity and Precision

- Ensure requirements are clear, concise, and unambiguous
- Avoid vague terms like "user-friendly," "fast," or "efficient" without specific metrics
- Define all terms and concepts that might be interpreted differently
- Make requirements testable and measurable whenever possible
- Each requirement should specify a single capability or constraint

## 2. Stakeholder Engagement

- Identify and involve all relevant stakeholders in requirements gathering
- Validate requirements with actual end-users when possible
- Document stakeholder priorities and resolve conflicting requirements
- Ensure executives and decision-makers approve key requirements
- Maintain traceability from requirements to stakeholders

## 3. Scope Management

- Clearly define what is in-scope and out-of-scope for the project
- Establish a formal process for handling scope changes
- Document dependencies between requirements
- Prioritize requirements (e.g., MoSCoW method: Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- Separate functional and non-functional requirements

## 4. Critical Thinking

- Challenge assumptions in requirements gathering
- Identify potential conflicts or contradictions in requirements
- Consider edge cases and exceptional scenarios
- Ask "why" to get to underlying needs rather than specified solutions
- Evaluate feasibility of requirements from technical and business perspectives

## 5. Documentation

- Document requirements in a structured, searchable format
- Use consistent templates and naming conventions
- Include rationale behind requirements where helpful
- Ensure requirements are traceable to their source
- Version control all requirements documentation

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- Define performance requirements with specific metrics
- Specify security and compliance requirements explicitly
- Include accessibility requirements appropriate to the user base
- Document scalability and capacity requirements
- Consider internationalization and localization needs early

## Requirements Analysis Phase Focus Tips

- Use multiple elicitation techniques (interviews, surveys, observation)
- Create user stories, use cases, or scenarios to capture user needs
- Develop prototypes to validate understanding of requirements
- Conduct regular reviews of requirements with stakeholders
- Document assumptions and constraints that influence requirements
- Consider the complete lifecycle of features, not just initial implementation
