# Cross-Phase Software Development Practices

This document highlights important practices that span multiple phases of the software development lifecycle. Rather than being confined to a single phase, these practices should be applied continuously throughout development.

## 1. Contract Preservation

**Applies to:** Design, Implementation, Maintenance, Refactoring

- **NEVER** break existing contracts (APIs, interfaces, function signatures) without explicit approval
- Honor semantic contracts - maintain identical behavior even when implementation changes
- When contract changes are unavoidable, version the interface or provide adapter layers
- Test contractual behavior thoroughly after any changes

## 2. Documentation as a Continuous Process

**Applies to:** All Phases

- Keep documentation updated throughout all development phases
- Document decisions as they're made, not after the fact
- Treat documentation as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought
- Use consistent documentation style across the entire project lifecycle
- Ensure traceability between requirements, design, code, and tests

## 3. Security by Design

**Applies to:** Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment

- Consider security implications from the earliest stages
- Implement security controls appropriate to the identified risks
- Test security controls throughout the development process
- Perform security reviews at each phase transition
- Update security measures in response to new threats

## 4. Testing Throughout

**Applies to:** Requirements, Design, Implementation, Maintenance

- Start testing activities early - validate requirements and designs
- Use test-driven approaches where appropriate 
- Maintain consistent test coverage during refactoring
- Update tests when requirements or interfaces change
- Automate testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, system)

## 5. Performance Awareness

**Applies to:** Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance

- Consider performance implications during architecture and design
- Establish performance baselines and requirements early
- Monitor performance throughout development
- Profile before optimizing to find actual bottlenecks
- Include performance testing in regular test cycles

## 6. Stakeholder Communication

**Applies to:** All Phases

- Maintain open communication channels with stakeholders throughout
- Provide regular updates on progress and changes
- Seek feedback at each development phase
- Ensure requirements remain aligned with stakeholder needs as they evolve
- Document key decisions and their rationales for stakeholders

## 7. Technical Debt Management

**Applies to:** Design, Implementation, Maintenance

- Be conscious of technical debt introduction
- Document known technical debt items
- Allocate time for technical debt reduction
- Assess the impact of technical debt on future work
- Balance short-term needs with long-term code health

## 8. Simplicity and Maintainability

**Applies to:** Design, Implementation, Maintenance 

- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Design for maintainability from the beginning
- Keep functions, methods and classes focused on single responsibilities
- Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering
- Consider the maintenance implications of all technical decisions

## 9. Configuration Management

**Applies to:** Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance

- Manage configurations consistently across environments
- Separate configuration from code
- Control access to production configurations
- Document configuration options and their effects
- Test with different configurations to ensure flexibility

## 10. Critical Thinking and Adaptability

**Applies to:** All Phases

- Question assumptions at every phase
- Adapt processes based on project feedback
- Learn from mistakes and successes
- Never be a "yes-person" - provide constructive challenges
- Consider contexts and constraints when applying best practices
