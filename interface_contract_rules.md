# Interface Contract Rules

## Overview
These rules govern how to manage interfaces between different layers and components of a system during development and refactoring.

## Key Principles

### 1. Document All Layer Contracts
- **API to UI Contract**: Document endpoint URLs, request/response structures, HTTP methods, and status codes
- **API to LLM Adapter Contract**: Document method signatures, error handling, and response standardization
- **Adapter to Model Provider Contract**: Document authentication, provider-specific requests, and response parsing
- **API to Data Storage Contract**: Document file naming, data serialization formats, and storage locations

### 2. Preserve Contracts During Refactoring
- Maintain backward compatibility whenever possible
- When refactoring components, ensure the interfaces they expose remain unchanged
- Use adapter patterns to accommodate changes in implementation without changing interfaces
- Run integration tests before and after refactoring to verify contract preservation
- Document any temporary compatibility bridges or shims

### 3. Establish Contract Change Process
- Document contract changes in dedicated changelog files
- Update all consumers and providers of the interface
- Create comprehensive tests for the new contract version
- When possible, maintain backward compatibility during transition periods
- Implement versioning for APIs with breaking changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### Contract Documentation
- Store interface contracts in dedicated documentation files
- Include example request/response pairs for each interface
- Document error handling and expected behavior for edge cases
- Update documentation when contracts change

### Testing Strategy
- Create integration tests specifically targeting interface boundaries
- Automate contract validation tests
- Test with mock implementations to verify contract adherence
- Include contract tests in CI/CD pipelines

### Versioning Strategy
- Use semantic versioning for API contracts
- Explicitly mark deprecated interfaces and provide migration paths
- Support at least one previous version when making breaking changes
- Plan for phased rollouts of contract changes

## Practical Application
- Before refactoring, identify all contracts that might be affected
- Create a contract preservation plan
- Implement changes while maintaining existing contracts
- Update tests to verify contract preservation
- Document any changes made to contracts
