# Dev Rules Repository

A comprehensive collection of software development rules, best practices, and guidelines organized by development phase, technology stack, and cross-cutting concerns.

## Overview

This repository contains curated rule sets for different aspects of software development. Each file provides specific guidance relevant to a particular phase, technology, or concern.

## Structure

## Using These Rules

- Refer to the [index.md](index.md) for a complete overview of all available rules
- Use the appropriate rule file for your current development phase or technology
- Many practices overlap between areas - cross-references are provided where relevant
- Critical rules are marked with **NEVER** or **ALWAYS** for emphasis
- Create a project-specific checklist based on these rules as needed
- Adapt these rules to your project's specific context and constraints

## Maintaining These Rules

- Focus on consolidating and refining existing rules rather than just adding new ones
- When a new lesson is learned, first check if an existing rule can be enhanced
- Periodically review all rules for relevance, clarity, and consistency
- Remove or archive outdated rules to prevent rule bloat
- Maintain a reasonable number of rules to ensure they remain practical to follow
- Test rules by applying them to past mistakes to verify they would have prevented the issue

## Learning and Improvement

- [Lessons Learned](lessons_learned.md) contains a record of past mistakes and their impact
- Review lessons learned periodically to avoid repeating past mistakes
- Contribute new insights and lessons as they are discovered
