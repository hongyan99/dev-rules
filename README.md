# Software Development Rules and Guidelines

This repository contains a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines for software development across all project phases. These rules are designed to improve code quality, prevent common mistakes, and ensure consistent practices across projects.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by development phases and cross-cutting concerns:

### Development Lifecycle Phases

1. [Requirements Analysis](requirements_analysis_rules.md) - Rules for gathering and documenting requirements
2. [Design](design_phase_rules.md) - Rules for system architecture and component design
3. [Implementation](implementation_phase_rules.md) - Rules for writing clean, maintainable code
4. [Testing](testing_rules.md) - Rules for effective test development and execution
5. [Deployment](deployment_rules.md) - Rules for reliable application deployment
6. [Maintenance](maintenance_phase_rules.md) - Rules for maintaining and refactoring existing code

### Cross-cutting Concerns

1. [Performance Optimization](performance_optimization_rules.md) - Rules for improving application performance
2. [Security](security_rules.md) - Rules for secure coding and system design
3. [Documentation](documentation_rules.md) - Rules for comprehensive documentation
4. [Cross-Phase Practices](cross_phase_practices.md) - Rules that span multiple development phases

### Learning and Improvement

1. [Lessons Learned](lessons_learned.md) - Record of past mistakes and their impacts, with lessons extracted

## Using These Rules

- Start by reading the [index](index.md) file for an overview
- Refer to the appropriate rule file for your current development phase
- Review [cross_phase_practices.md](cross_phase_practices.md) for practices that span multiple phases
- Use [lessons_learned.md](lessons_learned.md) to avoid repeating past mistakes

## Referencing in Projects

To apply these rules across all your projects:

```markdown
This project follows the development rules defined in [dev-rules](https://github.com/yourusername/dev-rules).
```

## Contributing

These rules should evolve based on experience:

1. When a new lesson is learned, first check if an existing rule can be enhanced
2. Focus on consolidating and refining existing rules rather than just adding new ones
3. Periodically review all rules for relevance, clarity, and consistency
4. Test rules by applying them to past mistakes to verify they would have prevented the issue
